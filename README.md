# RemBot

> An automated cryptocurrency trading bot for **Binance** that combines **R**SI, **E**MA, and **M**ACD — the **REM** trio — to detect confluence-based LONG/SHORT signals.

---

## 📖 Description

RemBot is a Python trading bot that connects to the Binance API and opens LONG or SHORT positions when REM (RSI, EMA, MACD) conditions are met. It uses clear abstractions with object‑oriented design and pragmatic design patterns to keep the codebase clean and maintainable without sacrificing functionality. The project also serves as a concise reference implementation for developers building their own trading bots.

---

## 🎯 Strategy

> **REM = RSI + EMA + MACD**

This bot relies on the following indicator set:

- **Trend filter (EMA)** – Evaluates the price relative to the 100-period Exponential Moving Average (`EMA_100`) to determine whether the market bias is bullish or bearish.
- **Momentum (MACD)** – Uses the relationship between the MACD line and the signal line to assess both the direction and strength of the trend.
- **Momentum (RSI)** – Applies a short-period RSI threshold around the 50 level to confirm the momentum direction and filter out false signals.

**Position entry conditions (pseudocode):**

```py
while True:
    if price < EMA_100 and MACD_12 > MACD_26 and MACD_12 < 0 and RSI_6 > 50:
        enter_long()
    elif price > EMA_100 and MACD_12 < MACD_26 and MACD_12 > 0  and RSI_6 < 50:
        enter_short()
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

First, rename `settings.example.toml` to **`settings.toml`** and edit the fields to match your preferences.

| `SECRET_KEY`     | `[API]`      |  string |        `""` | Your Binance API secret. Keep it secret and out of the repo.                                  | `"wJalrXUtnFEMI..."` |
| `SYMBOL`         | `[POSITION]` |  string | `"ETHUSDT"` | Trading symbol (e.g., USDT-M futures or spot pair).                                           | `"BTCUSDT"`          |
| `COIN_PRECISION` | `[POSITION]` | integer |         `2` | Quantity precision for orders. Must align with the exchange **lot size** rules.               | `3`                  |
| `TP_RATIO`       | `[POSITION]` |   float |    `0.0050` | Take-profit distance **relative to entry**. `0.0050` = **0.5%**.                              | `0.0100`             |
| `SL_RATIO`       | `[POSITION]` |   float |    `0.0050` | Stop-loss distance **relative to entry**. `0.0050` = **0.5%**.                                | `0.0075`             |
| `LEVERAGE`       | `[POSITION]` | integer |         `1` | Leverage to apply (for futures). Use responsibly.                                             | `5`                  |
| `TEST_MODE`      | `[RUNTIME]`  |    bool |      `true` | Paper/Test mode. When `true`, no live orders are sent (or a testnet is used).                 | `false`              |

> Tips
>
> - Keep `COIN_PRECISION` in sync with `exchangeInfo` (lot/tick size) to avoid rejected orders.

## ▶️ How to Run

> Ensure `settings.toml` is properly configured **before** running.

There are three ways to run the bot, and you may choose whichever best suits your needs.

### 1) Release

Download the latest release and run the executable.

### 2) Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t rembot .

# Run (Linux/macOS)
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/src:/app/src" \
  rembot

# Run (Windows CMD)
docker run --rm \
  -v "%cd%\src:/app/src"
  rembot
```

> The volumes mount your local `src/` for output log files.

### 3) Python (virtualenv)
